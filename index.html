			<h2> Scout: Who's Raising? </h2>
				<p class = 'lead'>
					Like other founders, I get approached often by entrepreneurs looking for help raising their next round. 
					If they’re good, I introduce them to my investors.  
					Most closed venture deals start out like this – they’re network referrals from people investors trust.
				</p>
					
				<p class = 'lead'>As an investor, you miss out on a lot of deals simply because you don’t find out about them. 
					They’re never even referred to you because they're outside your network.</p>
					
					<p class='lead'>Scout is a new way for investors to avoid missing deals. 
						We combine introductions from a network of founders and send them to our backers.</p>
