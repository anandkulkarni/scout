			<h2> Scout: Who's Raising? </h2>
				<p class = 'lead'>
					Like other founders, I get approached often by entrepreneurs looking for help raising their next round. 
					If they’re good, I introduce them to my investors.  
					Most closed venture deals start out like this – they’re network referrals from people investors trust.
				</p>
					
				<p class = 'lead'>As an investor, you miss out on a lot of deals simply because you don’t find out about them. 
					They’re never even referred to you because they're outside your network.</p>
					
					<p class='lead'>Scout is a new way for investors to avoid missing deals. 
						We combine introductions from a network of founders and send them to our backers while they're still fresh.
					This helps everyone: vetted entrepreneurs get in front of more investors and nobody misses out on the best deals.
					</p>

		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3> 
		<h4>Who's in the scout network?</h4>
		<p>A few YC founders.</p>
		<h4>How do you source deals?</h4>
		<p>Founders making introductions to their own investors can choose to do that through Scout more quickly than writing several emails.</p>
		<h4>Why are you doing this?</h4>
		<p>Financial returns in startup investing are weighted heavily towards outliers. Missing outliers is costly, so information about who's fundraising is valuable.</p>
		<h4>Why are you really doing this?</h4>
		<p>Fundraising is a pain and the early-stage investing market is illiquid. By combining information from multiple dealflow sources, you can create a more liquid market in the early stages.</p>
<!--		<h4>How do you know the deals are good?</h4>
		<p>Founders making introductions must have skin in the game on each investment.</p>
		<h4>How will Scout make money?</h4>
		<p>We co-invest on deals that go through.</p>
		<h4>Can I limit the kinds of deals I receive?</h4>
		<p>Not yet, but soon.</p>-->
