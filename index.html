			<h2> Scout: Who's Raising? </h2>
				<p class = 'lead'>
					Like other founders, I'm often approached by entrepreneurs looking for help 
					raising their next round. 
					If they’re good, I introduce them to my investors.  
					Most closed venture deals start out like this – they’re network referrals 
					from people investors trust.
				</p>
					
				<p class = 'lead'>
					As an investor, you miss out on a lot of deals simply because you don’t find out about them. 
					They’re never even referred to you because they're outside your network.
				</p>
					
				<p class='lead'>
					Scout combines vetted high-quality introductions from founders all over the valley into a single stream. 
Strong entrepreneurs get in front of more investors and you won't miss any deals. Everybody wins.</p>
